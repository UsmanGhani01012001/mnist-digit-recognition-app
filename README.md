# 🧠 MNIST Digit Recognition with Deep Learning & Interactive Image Prediction

A complete machine learning project that trains, evaluates, and deploys a handwritten digit recognizer using the MNIST dataset. It includes two neural network models and an interactive digit prediction system built with OpenCV and `ipywidgets`.

---

## ✅ Highlights

- 🔢 Trains on the MNIST dataset (handwritten digits 0–9)
- 🤖 Implements two models: Sigmoid-based and ReLU+Softmax-based
- 📊 Full evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix
- 🖼️ Predicts digits from custom JPG/PNG images with digit segmentation
- 💻 Web-style interface built using Jupyter and ipywidgets (no frontend coding needed)
- 📁 Clean modular codebase: ideal for showcasing to recruiters or extending to other CV tasks
